            <p>Java is one of the world's most popular programming languages. It was released in 1995 to serve as a
                programming language that would run code consistently on any machine.</p>
            <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language. An object is an individual instance of a class, which is
                a section of code that defines the structure of objects. In Java, your code will not compile unless it
                is a part of a class. For example, the following code would not run:</p>
            <code>System.out.print("Hello World");</code>
            <p>In order to get this code to run, we have to put it in a class that contains a main method. The main
                method tells Java where to start running your code. Most of the time, your code will also be inside of a
                package, which defines where your code is saved on your computer, but it is not necessary for your code
                to compile. The following is what a complete .java file might look like for a "Hello World" program.</p>
            <code>
            package helloWorld;<br>
            <br>
              public class HelloWorld {<br>
            <br>
                public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
            //this is the main method <br>
                  System.out.print("Hello World");<br>
          }<br>
            }
          </code>

        <section id="Variables_and_Data_Types" class="main-section">
            <header id="topic2">Variables and Data Types</header>
            <p>Here are 5 basic data types in Java</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integers</li>
                <li>Floats and Doubles</li>
                <li>Characters</li>
                <li>Strings</li>
                <li>Booleans</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Integers are whole numbers. Some examples include 13, 0, -1, 7, and 903.</p>
            <p>Floats and doubles are numbers with decimals. Doubles can store numbers that are twice as long as floats,
                so use doubles if you anticipate using large numbers or need a high degree of precision. Some examples
                include 2.71828, 1.00, 39.99, -17.3019, and 0.0.</p>
            <p>Characters are single characters. Examples include a, z, 1, #, and å­—.</p>
            <p>Strings contain one or more characters. Examples include abc, hello world, p@55w0rd, z, and 123.
            <p>
            <p>Booleans are a special data type that are always only ever True or False</p>
            Here are some ways to declare, initialize, and use variables.
            <code>
            <br> int x = 0; <br>
          boolean coinToss; <br>
          double half; <br>
            half = x / 4; <br>
            char favLetter = 's'
            String zipCode = "10001"; <br>
          </code>
        </section>
        <section id="Conditionals" class="main-section">
            <header id="topic3">Conditionals</header>
            <p>Conditionals are code that only run when certain conditions are met.</p>
            <code>
            if (coinToss == True) {<br>
            System.out.print("Heads");<br>
            }<br>
            else {<br>
            System.out.print("Tails");<br>
            }
          </code>
        </section>
        <section id="Loops" class="main-section">
            <header id="topic4">Loops</header>
            <p>Loops are sections of code that run repeatedly until a condition is broken.</p>
            <p>There are two types of loops: while loops and for loops. While loops are generally used when the number
                of times the loop will repeat is unpredictable, otherwise for loops are preferred.</p>
            <p>The following code shows how to use either type of loop to calculate a factorial.
                <code>
            <br>
            int factorial = 1; <br>
            int x = 10; <br>
            while (x > 1) { <br>
            factorial = factorial * x; <br>
            x = x - 1; <br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            for (int x = 10; x > 1; x = x - 1) {<br>
            factorial = factorial * x; <br>
                                   }
          </code>
            <p>Note that the variables are declared outside of the while loop but inside the for loop. Because of this,
                when using a for loop, the variables will not be accessible outside of the loop.</p>

            <p>Now you should be familiar with the basics of programming with Java. While the syntax may vary from
                language to language, these basic principles should hold true across most programming languages. Good
                luck and happy coding!</p>
