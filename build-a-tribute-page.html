      <h3>Who was Sally Ride?</h3>
      <p>Sally Ride was the first American woman to fly in space. She was born May 26, 1951, in Los Angeles, California.
        After high school, she attended Stanford University, where she earned bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees
        in physics. </p>
      <p>Ride applied to be an astronaut in 1977. It was the first time that women were invited to apply to the
        astronaut program. She was a college student and saw an advertisement that NASA was looking for women
        astronauts. She was one of six women selected to the astronaut corps in 1978.</p>
      <p>On June 18,1983, Sally Ride became the first American woman to fly in space. She was a mission specialist on
        the STS-7 space shuttle mission. During her flight, Ride worked the robotic arm to help release satellites into
        space. She flew on the space shuttle again in 1984 on the STS 41-G mission.</p>
      <p>Ride retired from NASA in 1987. She became a professor at the University of California San Diego. She also
        looked for new ways to encourage women and girls to study science and mathematics. Until her death on July 23,
        2012, Ride continued to help students - especially girls - study science and mathematics.</p>
